Share What You Know

There's three ways to share on MapStory. Just remember A, B, C. First, you can add new spatially and temporally enabled datasets, which we call StoryLayers. Second, you can build MapStories using StoryLayers and other narrative elements that you would like. Finally, you can curate content that appears on MapStory to improve its quality and accuracy.

MapStory is a nonprofit open educational resource. We rely on users like you to launch new initiatives, develop new tools and raise funds to keep the project going. So, get involved and build the future of MapStory that you want to see!
