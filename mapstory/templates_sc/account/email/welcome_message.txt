Hi, {% firstof confirmation.email_address.user.first_name confirmation.email_address.user.username %}!

By creating an account, you've joined a community of global citizens working together to organize data and tell stories about how our world has changed, is changing, and might change over time. We come from different places and have different interests, but we are connected by our belief that knowledge is meant to be shared and can always be improved!

Here's how you can get started:

Learn

Storyscapestelling involves using open data, maps and your own reflection to illuminate change in place over time. It's something anyone can learn, and your peers are adding more resources all the time to help you along.

Share What You Know

There's three ways to share on Storyscapes. Just remember A, B, C. First, you can add new spatially and temporally enabled datasets, which we call StoryLayers. Second, you can build MapStories using StoryLayers and other narrative elements that you would like. Finally, you can curate content that appears on Storyscapes to improve its quality and accuracy.
