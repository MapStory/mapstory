Deployment
----------


## local developer build

clone the following repositories as siblings of each other:
* https://github.com/MapStory/MapLoom
* https://github.com/GeoNode/geonode
* https://github.com/MapStory/geoserver-geonode-ext
* https://github.com/MapStory/mapstory

**This is incompatible with the vagrantfile - which is configured to assume a clone of the *mapstory* meta-project.**

**If one was to work on a module - and fork it - then how do you work with the fork in the context of the vagrant approach?**

* https://github.com/ischneider/geotools (optional - only needed for extended datetime support)

**_check this last one - what is the status of this and what does it mean in practice?_**

a manual build process is described in [manual_setup.md](manual_setup.md)

an automated virtual machine provisioning process using vagrant is documented in [scripts/provision/README.md](scripts/provision/README.md)
